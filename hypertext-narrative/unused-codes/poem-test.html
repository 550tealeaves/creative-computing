                    Tell me Pluto,
                    how does it feel
                    to be told you’re a planet for years
                    and then labelled as an accessory for our solar system?
                    But also, to be reassured, that although you’re small,
                    you’re just as good as the rest,
                    and endearingly enough,
                    someone’s favourite planet?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And while you sit on the outskirts,
                    in the far, vast, pitch black
                    edges of a far brighter galaxy than you,
                    do you marvel at the beauty and size
                    of every other planet judged more
                    legitimate and important than you,
                    and do you make friends with the microscopic stars?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You are told you aren’t what you are,
                    and you are what you aren’t,
                    I wouldn’t blame you for drifting further,
                    I think I would probably do the same.
                    But know some are very passionate
                    about your state in our galaxy,
                    many people believe you to be of importance;
                    whether it’s nostalgia, empathy or just fear of change.
                    Regardless, you have a small army
                    of people who are very vocal,
                    about your right to be alongside with all the other planets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just because you’re small
                    and not as visually appealing as the rest,
                    or because you’re pushed to the coldest, darkest regions of space, does not make you deserving of
                    isolation.
                    Infact, it makes you more worthy of adoration.
                    For you Pluto, for all the hardships
                    and all the abandonment you have felt,
                    you have never told another planet they themselves, weren’t real,
                    and you’ve never drawn anyone close to you,
                    to suffer in your loneliness.
