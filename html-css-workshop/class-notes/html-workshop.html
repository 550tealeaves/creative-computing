<h1>Deiter Rams: 10 Commandments for Good Design</h1>

<h3>Good design:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Is innovative
        – The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always
        offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving
        technology, and can never be an
        end in itself. Makes a product useful – A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional,
        but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst
        disregarding anything that could
        detract from it.</li>

        from it.</li>

    <li>Is aesthetic
        – The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have
        an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful. Makes a product
        understandable – It clarifies the
        product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the
        user's intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.</li>

    <li>Is unobtrusive
        – Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their
        design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</li>

    <li>Is honest
        – It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt
        to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</li>

    <li>Is long-lasting
        – It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many
        years – even in today's throwaway society.</li>

    <li>Is thorough down to the last detail
        – Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the
        consumer.</li>

    <li>Is environmentally friendly
        – Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and
        minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</li>

    <li>Is as little design as possible
        – Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with
        non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design Q & A with Charles & Ray Eames</h2>

<p>The questions and answers below were the conceptual basis of the exhibition
    Qu’est ce que le design? (What is Design?) at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Palais de Louvre in 1972.</p>

<h3>Questions by Madame. L. Amic, answers by Charles and Ray Eames:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “What is your definition of ‘Design,’ Monsieur Eames?"</li>
    <li>A: “One could describe Design as a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “Does the creation of Design admit constraint?”</li>
    <li>A: “Design depends largely on constraints.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “What constraints?”</li>
    <li>A: “The sum of all constraints. Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the
        Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within
        these constraints.
        Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, and so forth. Each problem has its
        own peculiar list.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “Does Design obey laws?”</li>
    <li>A: “Aren’t constraints enough?”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “Are there tendencies and schools in Design?”</li>
    <li>A: “Yes, but these are more a measure of human limitations than of ideals.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “Is Design ephemeral?”</li>
    <li>A: “Some needs are ephemeral. Most designs are ephemeral.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “Ought Design to tend towards the ephemeral or towards permanence?”</li>
    <li>A: “Those needs and Designs that have a more universal quality tend toward relative permanence.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Q: “How would you define yourself with respect to a decorator? An interior architect? a stylist?”</li>
    <li>A: “I wouldn’t.”</li>
</ul>

    <small><em>“Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful. But poise is usually far more important than size
            — and poise consists primarily of emptiness.”</em></small>
