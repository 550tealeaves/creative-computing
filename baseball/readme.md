This project is the first step in creating a game that demonstrates the important contributions of Black American players to baseball. 

The user will be able to hover over each player and see their birthdays, some stats, and a random fact. Then they can select from a list of players and begin the game. Each player is placed in accordance with their official career positions. 

The user will be able to play a game of baseball and learn more about some of the well known and lesser known Black players.
